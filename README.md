Each problem I compete has:
1) A subjective 1-10 rating of how hard I thought it was
2) A few comments on how I approached it

These ratings and comments can be found below.

### Day 1 - 2/10
Very straightforward use of nested loops. ***I completed several days of AoC 2019 using C++ as a learning experience. Even after a single puzzle this year, it is clear that Python will be much easier to pick up.***

### Day 2 - 3/10
Basic string manipulation. Interesting that I was off by one for a while because there was not a newline character for the last line of the input. Since I stripped newlines for all the other lines, the last `d` of the last password was not counted and the password was erroneously marked as invalid. ***May be cheating, but I just added a newline to the last policy/password to resolve this.***
* Realized how useful the `zip` function is for looping over parrallel lists
